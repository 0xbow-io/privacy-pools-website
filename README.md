## Overview

Privacy Pools UI is a decentralized application that enables private cryptocurrency transactions through advanced zero-knowledge proofs and commitment schemes. Users can deposit assets into Privacy Pools and withdraw them later (partially or fully) without creating an on-chain link between their deposit and withdrawal addresses. The system maintains regulatory compliance via an Association Set Provider (ASP) that validates deposits, preventing potentially illicit funds from entering the protocol.

## Features

- **Private Withdrawals**: Break the on-chain link between deposit and withdrawal addresses
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Integration with Association Set Provider (ASP)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Seamless deposit and withdrawal experience
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Configurable for multiple EVM networks

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PNPM v9.0.0+

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm run start
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

#### Prerequisites

1. [Vercel account](https://vercel.com)
2. Vercel CLI installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Authenticate with Vercel**:

   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

2. **Deploy Your Project**:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   Follow the prompts to configure your project.

3. **Set Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   vercel env add <name> <value>
   ```

   You can also set environment variables through the Vercel dashboard:

   - Go to your project
   - Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add all required variables from the table above

## üíª Development

### Conventional Commits

We follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) for all commits to maintain a clean and standardized commit history.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

Examples:

- `feat: add new withdrawal feature`
- `fix: resolve connection issue with ASP`
- `docs: update README with new environment variables`

## üîó Chain Configuration

The application supports multiple EVM networks through the `src/config/chainData.ts` configuration file. The application uses a whitelist of supported chains to ensure only approved networks are accessible.

### Whitelisted Chains

When adding a new chain, make sure to:

1. Add it to the `whitelistedChains` array
2. Configure it in the `chainData` object
3. Test the chain integration thoroughly

### Adding a New Chain

1. Import the chain from `viem/chains`:

```typescript
import { yourChain } from 'viem/chains';
```

2. Add the chain to the whitelist:

```typescript
// For mainnet chains
const mainnetChains: readonly [Chain, ...Chain[]] = [mainnet, yourChain];
// OR for testnet chains
const testnetChains: readonly [Chain, ...Chain[]] = [sepolia, yourChain];
```

3. Add the chain configuration to the `chainData` object:

```typescript
[yourChain.id]: {
  name: yourChain.name,
  symbol: yourChain.nativeCurrency.symbol,
  decimals: yourChain.nativeCurrency.decimals,
  image: yourChainIcon.src, // Add your chain icon to assets/icons/
  explorerUrl: yourChain.blockExplorers.default.url,
  rpcUrl: 'https://chain.rpc-url.com', // The RPC URL of the chain for the SDK
  aspUrl: 'https://aspUrl-example.com',
  relayers: [
    {
      name: 'Relayer Name',
      url: 'https://your-relayer-url.com'
    }
  ],
  poolInfo: {
    chainId: yourChain.id,
    assetAddress: '0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE', // Asset contract address
    address: '0x...', // Deployed PrivacyPool contract address
    scope: 1234n, // PrivacyPool scope
    deploymentBlock: 1234n, // PrivacyPool deployment block
    entryPointAddress: '0x...', // Deployed EntryPoint contract address
    maxDeposit: 1000000000000000000n, // Maximum deposit amount in wei (e.g., 1 ETH)
  },
}
```

### Adding New Relayers

To add new relayer endpoints for an existing chain:

1. Add the relayer object to the `relayers` array:

```typescript
relayers: [
  {
    name: 'Existing Relayer',
    url: 'https://existing-relayer.com',
  },
  {
    name: 'New Relayer',
    url: 'https://new-relayer.com',
  },
];
```

### Chain Icons

1. Add your chain icon to `src/assets/icons/`
2. Import it at the top of `chainData.ts`:

```typescript
import yourChainIcon from '~/assets/icons/your-chain.svg';
```

### Best Practices

- Keep mainnet addresses hardcoded for security
- Ensure all required fields are populated
- Test the configuration with the new chain/relayer before deploying
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for relayer services
- Only add chains to the whitelist after thorough testing
- Document any chain-specific requirements or limitations
